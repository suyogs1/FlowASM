  "short_description": "Visual n8n-style workflow builder for mainframe automation, combining assembly engines, 3270 terminals, and z/OS connectors into a unified Node.js platform.",
  "long_description": "FlowASM is a modern visual workflow automation platform that brings mainframe development into the 21st century. Built entirely with Node.js, it unifies disparate mainframe systems—IPLLab assembly engine, ZeroFrame 3270 automation, TK5/Hercules emulators, and z/OS endpoints—into a single drag-and-drop interface. Users can visually design workflows that compile assembly code, execute programs, submit JCL jobs, and automate terminal interactions, all from a web browser. The platform features an integrated Monaco code editor, real-time execution monitoring, and a sandboxed assembly engine for instant testing without external dependencies. FlowASM demonstrates the Kiroween theme of 'combining separate systems into a unified whole' by seamlessly integrating multiple mainframe technologies that traditionally operate in isolation.",
